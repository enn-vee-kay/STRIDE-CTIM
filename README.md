# STRIDE-CTIM
A Comparative Study on how different Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms work in effectively identifying the 6 Attack Vectors of STRIDE.

As technology advances, the risks of encountering cyber-attacks of various scales become increasingly prevalent. Despite a sharp-focus on end-user convenience, many organizations often fail to prioritize system security, which in turn leads to various cyber-attacks that have seemingly spiked in the recent times owing to the COVID-19 Pandemic.
 
To address these shortcomings, the technique of Advanced Cyber Threat Detection and Prevention Mechanisms [ACTDP] based on the concept of Defensive Security Measures and Blue Teams have been developed in the recent times. However, current approaches have been limited in their ability to effectively model and detect Cyber Threats. Traditional Defensive Mechanisms such as Intrusion Detection Systems [IDS] and Intrusion Prevention Systems [IPS] have been able to detect threats and subsequently any targeted attacks, but they are always prone to False Alarms [FAs] which can result [in Sensitive Cases] in Real Threats getting unnoticed.

Therefore, we as a part of our Mini Project are proposing a Machine Learning [ML] Based Cyber Threat Intelligence [CTI] Model using the STRIDE Framework. STRIDE stands for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service and Elevation of Privileges. The ML Model is trained on Large Datasets [preferably the NSL-KDD Dataset (or) equals] to more accurately identify threats and minimize FAs. 

The Use of Machine Learning results in improved Accuracy Levels when compared to its Traditional Counterparts. This lightweight and effective approach helps Cyber Security Teams efficiently mitigate the seemingly most dangerous threats that has the potential to cause catastrophic loss of information to many high-profile Organizations.
